# Wearables project using the UCI HAR data set for the Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning data'

As requested in the assignment, this repo contains the:
1) tidy generated data set (wearable_means.csv),
2) script for downloading, manipulating, and otherwise tidying the above data set (run_analysis.R),
3) code book describing the tidy data set (CodeBook.md)
4) readme (aka this file)

The raw data is stored in the UCI HAR Dataset directory. The code book was generated as an .Rmd file at the end of the run_analysis.R script and then manually edited in order to knit the included CodeBook.md. Descriptions of data manipulations are present in the code book (replicated below) as well as documentation in the run_analysis.R script. 

# Data manipulation summary
The data set was originally sourced from UCI HAR and tidied into the presented format
